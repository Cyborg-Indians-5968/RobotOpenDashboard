### How to Use
1. Go to Releases
2. Download the .zip of the latest version
3. Extract the files
4. Run the executable

NOTE: You must have a controller plugged in for the program to run!

This works like the FIRST driver station. Simply connect to the test bench network, choose your control mode, and enable when you're ready to test.

### Info for Programmers

- This program is written in C#. If you need to edit it, download Visual Studio 2019, clone the repository, and open the solution (.sln) file.
- The Arduino program is also included in the release. It's already on the test bench, but if you need to edit it, download the Arduino IDE.
- If you do end up editing anything, commit the changes (if applicable) and create a new release.
