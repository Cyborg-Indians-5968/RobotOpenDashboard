### Info for Programmers

- This program is written in C#. If you need to edit it, download Visual Studio 2019, clone the repository, and open the solution (.sln) file.
- The Arduino program is also included in the release. It's already on the Arduino on the test bench, but if you need to edit it, download the Arduino IDE.
- If you do end up editing either file, commit the changes (if applicable) and create a new release.
